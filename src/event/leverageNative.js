			//    changes that should be observed by registered listeners (such as
			//    checkbox toggling and focus updating), then clears the stored value.
			// 2. For an [inner] native event (detected by `saved` being
			//    an array), it triggers an inner synthetic event, records the
			//    result, and preempts propagation to further jQuery listeners.
			// 3. For an inner synthetic event (detected by `event.isTrigger & 1` and
			//    array `saved`), it prevents double-propagation of surrogate events
			//    but otherwise allows everything to proceed (particularly including
			//    further listeners).
